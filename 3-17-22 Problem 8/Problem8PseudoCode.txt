numUnivalSubtrees(binaryTreeRoot):
    int out = 0
    _numUnivalHelper(binaryTreeRoot, out)
    return out

_numUnivalHelper(curr, total):
    if(curr.left.getData == curr.right.getData)
        if(curr.left.getData == null)
            out++
        else
            _numUnivalHelper(curr.left, out)
            _numUnivalHelper(curr.right, out)

This is not right but the general idea. What is wrong is how to get the recursive method to kick back correctly
